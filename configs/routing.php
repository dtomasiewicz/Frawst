	 * This configuration file defines advanced routing information for

	 * To specify a custom routing instruction, add a key/value pair to the
	 * following array.
	 *   
	 * Examples:
	 *    'user/view/:id' => 'u/:id'
	 *    '^\d{2}$:lang/...' => '...'     // Request->option('lang') will be set
	 * 
	 * Note: By default, sub-requests do not follow these custom routing rules. You must
	 *       pass in your own Route instance if you want them to, though it is recommended
	 *       that you always use internal routes for sub-requests instead, since internal
	 *       routes are less likely to change.
