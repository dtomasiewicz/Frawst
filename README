Frawst Application Development Framework 0.1d (the *d* is for *development*!)
======

**What is this?**

Frawst is a hierarchial model-view-controller (HMVC) framework written for PHP 5.3+.

**But what does it do?**

Frawst strives to give consistent structure to applications without making the developers feel fenced-in to its design paradigm.

**Okay, but what's the difference between Frawst and all of the other PHP MVC frameworks out there?**

There are a few aspects that sets Frawst apart from the other options. Here are a few areas where it really shines:

1. Code generation is not something you will find here. Code generators and "scaffolding" are common features in many popular frameworks, and can be impressive in the beginning. But inevitably, your views and forms will become more detailed and complex, and you'll find yourself gradually factoring out the underlying scaffold. Rather than force you to make changes to someone else's code, Frawst encourages you to develop your own views and forms from the start with simple intuitive syntax and core helpers.
2. Almost all of us hate designing forms. As a primary source of user input, they inherintly become a primary source of security holes and errors. Frawst uses Form definitions to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) by making sure the data provided matches the fields available on the form it was sent by. These same form definitions allow for automatic repopulation, and extremely simple and extensible validation and filtering.
3. Unlike the other popular frameworks, Frawst is centred around a hierarchial MVC pattern. Sub-requests are cheap, and you are encouraged to use them frequently to limit unnecessary code duplication in your controllers and views while maintaining a logical flow.

**Sounds good, where do I start?**

At the moment, there is zero to no documentation available, so I don't really expect anyone else to be using this but myself. Does that mean I'm talking to myself? Oh well.

If you somehow managed to find this project, despite the non-existence of a website or any substantial documentation, then feel free to try it out and modify it at your own risk. Remember that it's still in initial development, so don't use it for anything important.

Eventually there will be a link to a website and perhaps some tutorials here; seeing as though I'm working and school is starting soon, I'm not sure when that will be.
