- put Validator in core library
- form validation
- re-integrate ORM into core? partially at least
- make ORM accessible to Form objects
- having to pass in the data object to Models every time they're constructed is
  a pain
- perhaps storing schemas in models is a good idea?
   - no reliance on model-specific describe()
   - tables can be created/updated automatically
   
changes to Model:
- make protected properties begin with an underscore
- add protected static _schema
- static properties shouldn't be changed
- remove primaryKey.. should be determined by _schema
